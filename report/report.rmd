#Abstract
This report replicates section 3.2 (Multiple Linear Regression) of the book *An Introduction to Statistical Learning*.

Concepts covered by this assignment include performing multiple regression analysis in R and using the package testthat.

#Introduction
This report analyzes the effects of different types of advertisement media on the overall sales of of a product. In the last assignment we only looked at the linear regression for Sales by TV, but now we will additionally perform a multiple regression analysis with all 3 advertising factors. 

#Data
Similarly to Homework 2, this assignment deals with the *Advertising.csv* dataset. It contains information about the advertising budgets for *TV*, *Radio*, and *Newspaper* advertisements as well as the resulting *Sales* in 200 markets.

Here are the summary statistics for the Advertising.csv dataset:

```{r,echo=FALSE,results='asis',message=FALSE}
xtable(all_summary,caption='Summary Statistics for Advertising.csv')
```

Additionally, here are the histograms of the distributions:

```{r,echo=FALSE,out.width='150px',message=FALSE,fig.align='center',eval=T,split=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics('../images/histogram-tv.png')
```


```{r,echo=FALSE,out.width='150px',message=FALSE,fig.align='center',eval=T,split=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics('../images/histogram-radio.png')
```


```{r,echo=FALSE,out.width='150px',message=FALSE,fig.align='center',eval=T,split=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics('../images/histogram-newspaper.png')
```

#Methodology

_Single Linear Regression_
From Homework 2, looking at the effect of either *TV*, *Radio*, or *Newspaper* on *Sales* is a single linear regression in which expected Sales is predicted from a given advertising medium.

This follows the form:

$$Sales = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} TV/Radio/Newspaper$$

_Mutliple Linear Regression_
Now, we look at the combined effects of TV, Radio, and Newspaper marketing on Sales so we perform a multiple linear regression model which follows the form:

$$Sales = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}*TV + \beta_{2}*Radio + \beta_{3}*Newspaper$$
